# Instructions

1. Create an MacOS Catalina 10.15.5 bootable USB. You can do this on a real Mac
 	 - Go into the app store and search for Catalina, once downloaded you can find the Installer.app inside Applications folder.
   - Earse the USB by using Disk Utility and rename the USB to MyVolume
   - Create bootable USB by using this command: sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolum
  
2. Mount the EFI-partition of the "Install macOS Catalina" disk.
   - You can do this using the Terminal with the following commands:
   - diskutil list
   - Once you have found the disk for example disk0s1 runt the following command to mount the EFI partition:
   - sudo diskutil mount disk0s1
   - Enter the password and the EFI partition should be mounted 
   
3. Delete all folders and then copy my EFI folder to the root of the EFI-partition
4. Go to EFI/OC and open the config.plist with a plist Editor (You can use PlistEditor Pro use google for this)
5. Once the config.plist is open navigate to PlatformInfo/Generic and paste your serials for MLB, SystemSerialNumber and SystemUUID. (you can use CorpNewt's GenSMBIOS)
6. Boot from the bootable USB and install macOS.
7. Once macOS is installed you can copy the EFI folder to the EFI partition of the internal SSD/HDD
